Hello All!

This is Doug. I'm a new Python developer with some theoretical programming experience in BASIC and FORTRAN.
I'm learning Python to develop code for use in scientific computing, web development, automation and robotics (starting with LEGO Mindstorms
Eventually, I'd like to learn all about Tensorflow and machine learning.
